# Welcome to the One and only UdaciRacer Simulation Game

## Project Introduction
For this final project for the course my task was to utilize a partially built-out game that races cars and work on several TODO comments to get the game to work. The project required that I use the all the asynchronous concepts I learned so far in the course. While working on the project I was able to strengthen my skills on how the event loop runs, which functions should execute first and which ones should wait for other tasks to complete before executing. I learned when to make an API Call and which functions should run while the reponse from API is pending. I also had good understanding of error handling in reference to callbacks, promises and async/await. 


The game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)

3. The race results view
